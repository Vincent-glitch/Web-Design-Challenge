I created a visualizations by plotting data to create dashboard website. I used data I acquired using the OpenWeather API in a previous project. <br>
This is a bare minimum website built with dataset I previously acquired. I used weather data to make visualizations and captioned them with simple  explanations. 
There is a main page we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data set.
